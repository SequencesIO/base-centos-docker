# base-centos-docker

Base docker image for CentOS 6/7 with runit.  This image is based
on phusion/baseimage.  The sequencesio/base-centos-docker uses the
same runit and my_init files as phusion/baseimage, with modifications
for everything to run on CentOS 6 and 7.

Refer to the phusion [github](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker) or [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/phusion/baseimage/) repositories for more
details on how the images are built.
